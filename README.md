# Speed Limit Fine Calculator

## In this project we simulate a transport system. We have a transportation company and the drivers of this company exceed speed limit over and over again. We want to find out how much we will pay for this mistakes. 

## We created a console app that asks the vehicle type, the road type, and the speed of the vehicle, and we calculated the fine according to these informations.

## We have three types of vehicles: car, bus and truck. The speed limit values are the following (in km/h):
## Vehicle Type	    Urban Areas	    Main Roads      Highways

###    Cars	            50	            90	          130
###    Buses	        50	            70	          100
###    Trucks	        50	            70	          80

## Our application should:
### •	satisfy the Single Responsibility Principle,
### •	use the Interface Segregation Principle,
### •	use Dependency Injection,
### •	include logging of the operations,
### •	follow Clean Code Principles.
